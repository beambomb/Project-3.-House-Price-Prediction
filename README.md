# Project-3.-House-Price-Prediction
I have made another machine learning simple project to predict a House Price given an infamous Fetch California Housing dataset, not only I made prediction of the house price but I also made a comparison between default model and tuned model, currently I'm using XGBRegressor Algorithms
